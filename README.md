# StrangeHorizons2017
Calibe recipe to download issues of the Strange Horizons online speculative
fiction magazine.

Before each use, change the variable "dateStr" (on line 12) to reflect the date
of the issue that you would like to fetch.  

    dateStr = "4-july-2005"

Strange Horizons typically publishes new issues on Mondays.  Reviews are
uploaded throughout the week, so it is a good idea to download the magazine on
the weekend to ensure all reviews are included.
